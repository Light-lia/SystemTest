            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir&rsquo;s pirate ship fleet had scoured the Eastern Border space of the System, and now it was devoid of all commerce ships. Desniir knew that it would happen eventually, after all, who would want to deal with him. AS he sat in the commanders seat, he began to spin in a slow circle. There was no sighting of any other ship for several days, and he was beginning to worry about his crew.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir brushed his fur. It got tangled often, but he loved to comb his hair with his claws, feeling the silky smooth hairs line up between his fingers. The other Cymins did not understand, after all, beauty as a concept was foreign to them as love. Atta seemed desperate for him to get of the fur products, believing that he was addicted. At one point she had taken all of his products, and hid them in the ventilation shafts all across the ship, forcing him to spend a few days with a couple of nymphs to scour the bottles. He kicked out Atta from the cabin for a few days. Her heart was in the right place, but Desniir wished that she would at least try to be more subtle.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Being the lone Muscan on a Cymin ship, would initially give strangers an offshoot glance. He was a mothlike being, comblike attanae, thick soft fur covered his body, and a three pairs of limbs. A fluffball, as some had described him. But Desniir quickened their expiration date for any of those who muttered that word. But the Cymins wer fairly accepting, to a certain degree. Unlike his soft edges, Cymins were tall, insectoid mantises, two large eyes and spinal. Thin bodies, that could maneuver into the tightest of spaces, and crawl in any ship. THey towered before any known creature, and their predatory instincts were hard to quell. THey were well suited to living in space, which was not much of a choice given their past. But the Cymin nymphs almost seemed to be of a different species. Brightly colored floral patterns and shapes. Their bodies seemed to resemble exotic flowers, and fauna, and their meek personality was often a sharp contradiction. Ageless unlike their adult counterparts. But Desniir did not find their biological immortality of their young to be that amusing. Many were far older in mind, than they first appeared to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>THe door to his command room opened, and Atta his assistant entered. Her exoskeleton was a bright crimson, with splashes of cooler colors. Her eyes focused on what she desired, and they were staring right at Desniir.&nbsp; Desniir avoided her piercing gaze if he could as he knew what was going to come out of her mouth,&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We need to dock the fleet.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>There it was. The bad news. Desniir spun around in his chair faster. Atta grabbed the arm of the chair. Desniir, head kept spinning.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; She demanded.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Dock the fleet. Like all the other times you&rsquo;ve told me.&rdquo; Desniir said.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Yes, good.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir combed his fur, and began to stare at the control desk. He didn&rsquo;t realize how many flashing lights there were. He knew what all of them meant of course, but taking a step back, and seeing how much he had to learn over the years amazed him. A rainbow of colors and symbols. Luckily, a ship being an older model&nbsp; still had some of the quality features. Textured keys, springs, variety of dampanders, all unique to each individual button, and if he had to, Desniir could fly the ship blind.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t we docked?&rdquo; Atta said, breaking the silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;THe issue is, we don&rsquo;t have enough fuel. No wait my apologies, we do have enough fuel but that would only take us to a one way trip to Sector 6, and that is not a priority on my list. I have another idea.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Atta did not move, still as a statue. The only detection of life was the slight twitch of her finger. Desniir let her wait, before replying,</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;What if we traveled outside of the system? TO another galaxy? Maybe they have fuel there.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the resources.&rdquo; Atta said without hesitation. Desniir had many names for Atta. The paincrow, trashmouth, Silent overseeder but most commonly, A dream killer. Desniir knew her not to be any different.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;If we did, would you consider it?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;ITs a bad idea irregardless, whether or not the fleet is prepared.&rdquo; Atta replied. &ldquo;Our navigation does not work outside the System, and our engines as well. But that is another reason why I&rsquo;m here. The engines. The Chief Engineer wants a word with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you talk to him, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Groaning, Desniir peeled himself out of the chair.&nbsp; He placed on his weapon belt, a blaster from the Harmony wars. It was said that one of the best snipers, Hera Badger used it in the war. A relic from a time before he was born. Desniir felt powerful when he wore that weapon. A carefully designed to have no trigger, as it would only shoot when the weilder was certain to kill the living. Desniir, having found the weapon at a discount market, a rare wonderful amongst worthless scrap metal and broken relics. He did not have too pay for it too, as the vendor was too slow to catch him. Or the sniper rifle was a fake. He wasn&rsquo;t too certain.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>The lights in the hallways were half on and dim, to conserve power. But there was a secondary reason, stealth. A powered ship would be noticed by other ships in space, but without any&nbsp; outgoing signals or lights. Commerce ships would not suspect them. Desniir, comb antennae twitched. The air movements, the taste was different. Someone was following him. Desniir grabbed his weapon from his belt and shot the shafts. A gasp rang out as the creature in the shafts was struggling. They never seem to learn. A group of nymphs, their eyes large, THeir exoskeleton, flowery and thin. Crawled up the wall to the vent and pulled out the body and threw it onto the floor. It was a half-formed Cymin maturing nymph to an adult. It would have made it to adulthood if it weren&rsquo;t for its poor decision. Taking their meal, the little nymphs scattered as the captain approached, dragging their dying friend in the darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>The head engineer Kai, witnessed it all but said nothing of it. Straight to business, like all Cymin do.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We need more replacement parts,&rdquo; Kai spoke. &ldquo;The engine is going to fall apart in no more than a half a cycle maybe ask the federation?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Absolutely not, Desniir&rsquo;s imminent thought crossed his mind. He would rather slather himself in oil and throw himself out of the airlock than to ever meet that group voluntarily. Being a member, he had to participate in their little get-together celebrations every once and awhile. But more often than not, he sent the resistant Atta in his stead. As a result, he did not have many strong connections with any functions that could pull himself out of this mess. Yet, as a federation of outlaws, they had decidedly split their territories, but Desniir took the furthest away, less annoyances and all.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Nice idea. But I have a better one. It will take a bit of time to implement.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; THe engineer asked.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir pulled Atta away. Atta gave worrying glances back at the engineer and to Desniir. She had already suspected him.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;You have a plan?&rdquo; Atta asked.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Desniir said. &ldquo;I do. It requires you to trust me a bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Atta nodded. Desniir shook the hand of the engineer.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We will dock the ship in less two days. I thank you for your hard work. May your nymphs be as talented as you.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>A beacon out into space. It was some tech he was able to pull off from a previous hijacking mission, and it finally came into use. Onto the screen several blinking lights emerged. Atta leaned in, her finger tracing the lights.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Those are Sector 6 ships.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;we are attacking the vessel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;IF you attack the vessel, the federation is going to confiscate another ship.&rdquo; Atta spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We lose one ship, and gain one ship. I win in any case. THere is nothing to lose.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>A flare of annoyance flashed across Atta&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Besides, we don&rsquo;t want another Hunger on this ship. The last time that happened, Half the fleet was lost.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t normal ships, I recognize the flash pattern.&rdquo; Atta said. She pointed at the screen. &ldquo; Those are Havana Lu transports. We can&rsquo;t attack them.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Havana Lu. Desniir s hands curled as his claws scratched the surface of the metallic panel. Even her name, spurred him into the dark abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say her name. We are attacking and thats it.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir pushed the controls and alerted all other ships in the fleet. Atta leaned away from Desniir. Desniir gripped the rifle grip. He did not want those thoughts, in his mind. Not while on a mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>His fleet formed a pincher formation. Four groups, one for frontal assault while three others enveloped the sides. His command ship in the front, as it always should be. The commerce ships would not escape him, like any other. HE could hear the small clicks of the mandibles of his Cymin captains. Their instincts priming them to kill Anything that can die. Ready to feed. Ready to fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir breathed, while he had done this many times before, he could not shake off the feeling of that he was going to fail. A gnawing parasite of paranoia in his mind. HE stretched out his wings, he was going to fly into victory today. THere will be no defeat.</span></p>
            <p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;IT doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s on those ships or who owns them. We are going to take it. Thats all. Understand? Now, lets get this ship cruising.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>The attack began. Smaller protection forces of the commerce ships began to attack but they were no use to a full experience of the Cymins. With smaller ships, the Nails began to pierce the sides of the commerce ships, bypassing the weak shields and damaging the victim ships further. Desniir commanded his captains to take the protection forces from the southeast, that was where their formations were weakest. In only a few moments past, and the battle in space was over, as the protection forces either destroyed,disabled, or fled. The Main ships boarded, unable to escape the clutches of Desniir&rsquo;s fleet. Desniir&rsquo;s antennae twitched. He could not wait to board.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Within, parts of his fleet and crew had already boarded the ships and made their rounds. Their results: blood splattered walls,&nbsp; and half-eaten corpses on the ground. Desniir heard yells and commotion echo against the metallic walls of the ship. Desniir felt the walls of the commerce ship. Brand new, the dust had yet to settle on the silent alarms systems above. THe ship perhaps only seen a few voyages before its dying day.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir reached where the sounds originated from. There, the crew of the commerce ship battled alone. Jahrens, short, thick round scales, and rectangular pupils. Their bodies head to toe covered in armor. Their eyes wide, and their mouths agape showing their shark like teeth as they screamed at one another, trying to get to cover. Trying to live a moment longer. Some had fallen to the clutches of the Cymin&rsquo;s claws, and it was far too late for them. But what they did not see, or know was the multiple pair of eyes staring down at them from the ceiling. The Silent Killers posed ready to strike. Desniir took out his rifle from his holster and aimed. With a few shots, the desperate crew was dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>from the ceiling shadows. And around the Cymins gathered to feast. The Cymins were grabbing the innards of the dying crew and shoving it in their mouths. The screams of the awake dying were grating. Desniir watched as the savage beasts consumed. The way that they ate as if they had been starving for years. Leaving no dignity or remains for their families to salvage. Desniirfelt Atta brush past him to join in on the feast. He may have been accepted by the Cymins, but he was not one. And he doubted that he would ever be.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Lord Desniir.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>An adult cymin bowed to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;No formalities. What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Their cargo their holding a relic ship, I have never seen one like it, and I know my ships.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Really? Show me.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>They entered the cargo hold of the ship. But there being cargo, as one would expect, there was a smaller ship. A vessel within a vessel. Double the bounty. Desniir rubbed his claws together excitedly. Finally luck was embracing him. But as he approached the entrance, there was a sense that he should not be there. The door was thick with rust and grim, as if the Cymins had to use all of their strength to pry it open. Aged and disheveled the ship was in obvious disrepair. It was beyond old, a design that was far gone in the past, but yet some of the markings were familiar. Desniir wanted to chalk it up to paranoia, but the emotion was overwhelming him. THe Cymins began to shift around, and shifting around, their stoicism breaking. The did not move into the ship.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Desniir demanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;There is danger here.&rdquo; THe Cymin replied.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Are you Cymins are you not? If anyone can face the danger it is you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Desniir pulled out his weapon. If anything could make a CYmin nervous, he should too as well. He then felt a irregular rhythm. It seemed to strengthen as. Desniir pushed on deeper.&nbsp; The inner vessel was covered in rust. Large chunks were missing, and the inner walls were devoid of any life bearing technology given to the ship. It was largely mechanical underneath all the oxidation. Desniir could not help but be shocked at the state of the ship, thousands of years old, and this could fly. Desniir could hardly believe that this was built by Celestians. They would never be able to fit in here. He looked at the chairs, no Celestian no matter how small they could be could ever use them. Perhaps it was human. But he did not hear of any ship built by humans, let alone crewed by them. Desniir had to crouch slightly to make it through the door ways, his attane brushing against the tops of the doorframe.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>He felt as if his whole body sinking into the ground. A pressure that was inhibiting his own movements. He had felt this before, a long time ago. Desniir pushed his back towards the wall, as he stared into oblivion. Calm down, he thought. Calm down. THere is nothing here that can hurt you.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>THe Cymins too, were experiencing the effects. Their confident murderous deamanor all gone, as they shuffled following the Muscan. Afraid of what they were going to find. Desniir himself, pushed towards the unnaturality. There was nothing that was going to stop him from exploring the darker parts of this abandoned ship.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Arriving in the engine room, the machinery was rusted, with pieces broken apart, on the floor. But strangely there was one device that was humming. It was the source of the aura. Desniir approached the machine, it was shaped as an egg. Black lacquer covered its surface, but some parts of the paint had flaked away to reveal the bright red metal underneath. Desniir had enver seen such a mahine in a spacecraft before. In a strange urge of curiosity, Desniir felt around the edges. It was a lid, rusted shut. The Cymins that could help him open it, were standing near the doorway, refusing to step foot inside. Desniir did not need their help. Using his claws he scrapped away the layers of rust onto the floor, until he could feel the pressure of the lid loosening. With one large heave he opened the machine. Black liquid poured out, viscous and opaque. Desniir stepped away, from what seemed like oil. But it did not smell like oil, nor did it smell of anything. THe Cymins then decided to enter, their curiosity piqued. They looked at the strange substance. There seemed to be odd images on the surface, faces. But they were undistinguishable from one another. Desniir thought he was hallucinating, as he could faintly hear voices from the liquid. But what was not a hallucination, was that there liquid that was still in the egg, was moving. A hand appeared, then another. It grabbed the edge, and whatever it was, it pulled itself out from the sludge. A human.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr"><span>Eyes wide as the black sludge poured out of his mouth. The human gripped the edge of the machine. His eyes wide. Naked, shivering, its eyes darted around at Desniir then at the Cymins. It had black matted hair, golden skin, and icy eyes that seemed to glow. A distinctive scar ran down from his right eyebrow. THe human coughed as it tried to gulp in air. Without thinking, Desniir approached the struggling human. The last moment that Desniir could remember was grabbing the human pulling him up from the machine.</span></p>
